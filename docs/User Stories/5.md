Description: The existing user of the web app needs to have control over their roomie requests and the ability to manage them. They want to view the status of their requests, including pending, accepted, or declined requests, and be able to respond to them by accepting or declining the requests to establish effective communication with potential roommates.

Details:

The existing user logs in to their account on the web app using their credentials.
Upon successful login, the user is redirected to their personalized dashboard or homepage. The user navigates to the section or feature dedicated to managing their roomie requests. The web app displays a list of requests sent by other users and the status of each request. Each request includes relevant details about the potential roommate, such as their name, profile picture, and any additional information provided by the user. The user can view the status of each link request, distinguishing between pending, accepted, or declined requests. If a request is pending, the user has the option to respond to the request. The web app provides buttons or links to accept or decline the link requests associated with each potential roommate. The user can click on the "Accept" button to accept a request from a potential roommate. The web app confirms the acceptance of the request and establishes communication between the existing user and the accepted potential roommate. If the user decides to decline a request, they can click on the "Decline" button associated with the respective request. The web app prompts the user to confirm their decision to decline the request. Upon confirming the decline, the web app updates the status of the request accordingly and notifies the potential roommate of the declined request. The web app allows the existing user to easily navigate back to the list of requests to manage other pending requests.
