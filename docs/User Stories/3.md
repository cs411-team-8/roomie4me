Description: I am a user who has used this site before. At the time when I created my account, I did not see any viable roommates, so I did not send anyone a “linkup request” myself; however, someone who just registered into the site just saw my profile and is interested in rooming with me and sent me a request.

Details:
I am sent an email from no-reply@roomie4.me informing me that I have a new roommate link request. The email includes the name of the potential roommate and also their email address and their phone number to contact them for further details. The user is also asked to follow-up with the site on whether the roommate request was completed or not.
