User: BU student

Description: A new user to the site who is a BU student who has already logged in needs to find suitable roommates and create a roommate request. They want to fill out a form with specific details about their preferences and requirements to ensure compatibility with potential roommates.

Details:

The user begins by navigating to the site’s home login screen. There, the user is presented with an oauth Google login. However, in this first attempt, the user attempts to log in with their personal, @gmail.com email. Consequently, as soon as they authorize oauth, the app presents them with a red pop-up error message staying, “you must use your @bu.edu email to log in!” on the original login page. Following this, the user signs into their @bu.edu email and is redirected to the site registration page for logged-in users. On this registration page, the user is asked to fill out the following details about their profile:
name: first name, last name, age, year of graduation, gender, languages, religious affiliation, international status, degree program(s), whether the smoke/drink alcohol/do other drugs, sleep schedule, and a ~100-250 word “about me” description.
Now, the user navigates to the "Create Roomie Request" section of the web app. They are presented with a form that includes fields to input their preferences and requirements for a potential roommate. They are also asked to fill in the target semester for which they need a roommate and a date by which they need to find a roommate. The user fills in the required fields and provides accurate and complete information about their preferences and requirements. They review the information entered and have the option to make any necessary changes before submitting the form. Upon submitting the form, the web app validates the input and ensures that all required fields are filled in correctly. If any required fields are missing or contain invalid information, the user is prompted to correct the errors in a popup error and resubmit the form (with out deleting their current input). Once the form is successfully submitted, the user receives a confirmation message indicating that their roommate request has been filed. The roommate request is saved in the system, associated with the user's profile, and made visible to other users searching for roommates. The user can view their own roommate request to verify the accuracy of the details provided. If the user wishes to make changes to their roommate request after submission, they can access the "Edit Roomie Request" feature to update the information.
